## Jurisprudences Classification

This project consists in carrying out a classification of the decisions of the French Court of Cassation carried out within the framework of a research internship,  you'll also find the paper I was able to write during this period of confinement and internship.


The data used is available in this link  : [LegiFrance](https://echanges.dila.gouv.fr/OPENDATA/CASS/)


The Colab link on the top of each notebook.
You will find 4 notebooks in this repo:
	
	00 : Creation of the file which gathers all the cases. 
	01 : Deep Analysis of the french Cass Dataset 
	02 : Classifier : TF-IDF + ML Algorithms
	03 : Classifier : CamemBERTforSequenceClassification
	
	
	
	
How to use it  : 

* Download the data in [This link](https://echanges.dila.gouv.fr/OPENDATA/CASS/)
* Execute $00$ locally using Jupyter notebook, it will take as input the folder downloaded, and allows you to create a .csv file containing all the case law.
* Upload the csv file (named in the notebooks freemium02) on google drive to mount it into drive easily.
